        <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
        <p>I am chaos! I am the storm! I am constantly making new projects without following through on the old ones!</p>

        <p>In real talk, I am a software engineer by trade, tinkerer by night. I have a wealth of projects that have inspiration, but lack follow through. I am making this blog to hold myself accountable.</p>
